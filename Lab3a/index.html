        <h2>Welcome to the hSchool of Computing Science and Digital Media</h2>
        <img id="dance" src="images\dance.jpg" alt="Dancing">
        <h2>Our courses develop skills and expertise for a wide-range of computing technologies and target applications.</h2>
        <p>From our state-of-the-art, purpose-built environment you will study forward-thinking professional practice, and learn the skills required to be at the forefront of digital and creative economies.
            Using emerging technologies, you will learn practical and creative problem-solving skills, and apply these to real challenges which are or will be faced by industry.
            You will also gain valuable technical,  personal and professional skills, to compliment you career-enhancing qualification.
        </p>
        <h2>TEACHING TRACK-RECORD</h2>
        <p>We take a lead in technology-enhanced learning through a combination of interactive lectures,
            group project work and practical exercises in state-of-the art computing laboratories. Our students frequently comment on the
            quality of support and teaching they receive, and several computing staff regularly win student-nominated prizes at RGU’s
            annual Star Awards.
        </p>

        <h2>FUTURE-READY GRADUATES</h2>
        <p>In 2016 Scotland IS (the organisation representing the IT sector in Scotland) estimated that the country would need at least 11,000 extra Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
            workers each year for the next five years – whilst there are only 2,000 ICT graduates per year from Scottish universities. Our range of courses address the skills-gap challenge facing the industry,
            and reflects the diversity of the modern computing landscape.
        </p>
